## 🛤️ Roadmap

The intention of this repository is to be a starter kit for multiplayer WebXR rooms. To get to this goal, the needed features are:

- Better controls for Non-XR mode.
- Streamlined way to deploy headless version to Unity Multiplay Hosting.
- Setting room creator from web as host.
- Using Addressables to load different parts (like minigames) only when needed.
- Performance optimizations. (Currently needs Desktop PC to run well)

This repository is meant to use Unity's services. Other multiplayer and voice-chat solutions might be better, but implementing them would be more appropriate in a fork.
